                Eyes are the windows to the soul. A smile is the mirror of the heart
                From the experience of my Dad’s tooth implantation and watching him afterwards, I would like to tell the cons of having a good dental care from a good dentist from my own experience.  
                Dentistry is the art of treating, diagnosing, and preventing diseases of the jaws, teeth, and surrounding tissues of our mouth. Dental treatment includes a wide range of dental services. Some of these services are based on correcting problems of the teeth caused mainly by dental decay. Such treatments often involves the use of some kind of dental fillings. Other services deal with the prevention and treatment of diseases of the teeth and their supporting tissues and nerves. Still others concentrate on the position of the teeth in relation to each other. Dentists may also treat injuries, infections, tumours, and various other problems of the jawbones, teeth , and related tissues. Having a dentist near me is the best solution to all these teeth problems.
                A dentist can help with implants to replace missing teeth. Implants are a permanent way to get back our smile, confidence and our ability to speak. If multiple teeth are missing, implants are much more efficient and cost-effective than traditional dentures. The All-On-Four implant allows just four implants to hold a full set of teeth. This means an optimum recovery time and a great smile. Waterlase technology allows the offices to use gentle laser energy and water for the procedures. The laser cuts both hard and soft surfaces. The precision means only the area targeted will be affected. This reduces swelling and recovery time. It also eradicates the need for drills and needles. All these treatments will leads to eat foods that were taboo with dentures. Implants truly are life-changing. 
                A big advantage of getting a dentist near me is that I have a one-stop dental hygiene solution for a long time. A family dentistry can take care of a patient right from infancy to adulthood even. If I have the right family dentist by my side, He is like a 24 hrs. Dentist and thus I can rest assured that my family’s dental hygiene is taken care at its best. A good family dentist does not just provide preventative treatments for the family, but also educated the entire family on good dental hygiene.
                A good family dentist can also provide with good dental cleaning process like:
